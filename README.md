# TheEndlessExpanse-SeniorProject

A senior project I did in 2013/2014 focusing on random generation and customizability within a game.

Code is uploaded for historical purposes only. Images are not licensed for open source, so have been removed and replaced (other than ones I've made myself). References to real people that are not me have been removed as well.
