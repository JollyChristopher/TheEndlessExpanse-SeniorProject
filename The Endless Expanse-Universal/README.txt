Running the Game:
1) Open a command window

2) run jar with java commands
- Linux/MacOS = java -jar The\ Endless\ Expanse.jar
- Windows = java -jar "The Endless Expanse.jar"
3) Game will automatically start in window. The jar must remain in the folder so it can have access to the assets. The Game folder can be moved anywhere without losing saved game data.

Saved game data is stored in your user folder in a hidden folder called .jme3/.endlessExpanse
You can then look at and edit the files in this folder, although it is not recommended.
