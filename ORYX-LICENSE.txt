Due to the license for assets used on this project, only I have license rights, and there is no right to redistribute the artwork. As a result, the 'Textures' of this game have been stripped out, and the game is no longer compilable as a result. There is a final compilation (made 2014) and a 'Manual' that shows examples of the game at time of creation. More information on this license can be found at https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/license
